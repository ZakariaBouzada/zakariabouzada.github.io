        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project involved designing and implementing an automated data pipeline
            following the medallion architecture on Microsoft Databricks. The goal was to
            ingest and process NBA player statistics in near real time and produce
            structured analytical datasets for performance analysis.
        </p>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The pipeline follows the medallion architecture pattern, consisting of Bronze,
            Silver, and Gold layers. Raw NBA statistics are ingested into the Bronze layer,
            cleaned and structured in the Silver layer, and aggregated into analytics-ready
            datasets in the Gold layer.

        <h2>My Role and Contributions</h2>
        <p>
            I was responsible for designing the pipeline architecture, implementing data
            transformations using Python and SQL, and configuring automated jobs within
            Databricks. Particular emphasis was placed on data quality, scalability, and
            clear separation of pipeline layers.

        <h2>Results and Visualization</h2>
        <p>
            The final Gold-layer datasets categorized NBA players based on scoring and assist
            performance. These datasets were used to build interactive dashboards in Power BI,
            enabling comparative analysis and trend exploration.

        <h2>Academic Note</h2>
        <p>
            Due to academic ownership and infrastructure restrictions, the source code and
            Databricks workspace for this project are private. This page documents the system
            design, methodology, and outcomes of the project.
