            <h3>Automated Medallion Data Pipeline (Academic Project)</h3>
            <p>Designed and implemented an automated data pipeline following the medallion architecture on Microsoft Databricks. The pipeline ingests NBA player statistics, performs structured transformations using Python and SQL, and produces analytical datasets categorizing players by scoring and assists. The project emphasized scalable data processing, data quality, and automation. Results were visualized using Power BI.
